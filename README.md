# what is testManager?
testManager is ts/js tool for automation test can work on server side(deno) and client side(any browser supporting esm)
# Why testManager?
we have deno builtin test tool why another ? <br> 
the response that we need some kind of universal test tooling that can be runned with deno and broser too.<br>
for example rest-api can documented by test that we can run on browser,test can be shared between fronted and backend dev, not only frontend dev can understand rest-api endponts, methods, request body structure .., but he has js/ts functions can use them in his code to consume the rest-api...a lot of things you say here.
# how to use ?
testManager is easy to use, just clone this reposetory in your machine and run examples,in fact we have two examples sever and client
## for server side test ?
 clone this reposetory in your machine <br>
 read examples/server/readme.md to  see how to run , if you don't understand open issue
## for client side test? 
 clone this reposetory in your machine <br>
 read examples/server/readme.md to to  see how to run, if you don't understand open issue
# use case
- rest-api test in browser by backend dev
- test as rest-api doc that can be shared between frontend and backend dev
- may be other use cases...
# testManager deps
testManager code has no deps, I think it  can work with all deno version
# qustions and suggestions are welcome
